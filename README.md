# FormulaOneDBMS
The F1 Race Management System is a Python–MySQL-based application designed to efficiently manage and analyze data related to Formula 1 drivers. It serves as a database-driven management tool that allows users to store, update, and organize driver information such as name, team, and championship points in a structured and reliable way.

By combining the power of Python’s simplicity and MySQL’s robust data storage, the system provides an interactive console-based interface for users to:
	•	Add new driver details
	•	Update existing records
	•	Display all driver data neatly formatted
	•	Search for specific drivers
	•	Delete outdated or duplicate records
	•	Export driver data into CSV files for analysis
	•	View a sorted Leaderboard displaying the top-performing drivers
